# MediaPipe Hand Controller

Start by installing the python packages in the `requirements.txt` and use python 3.7.

The software is in the `controller.ipynb`

The arduino files are in the `/base/` folder. In there is a custom script for the hand we use. But some things there may be scrappable.
